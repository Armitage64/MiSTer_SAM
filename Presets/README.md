# mrchrisster-MiSTer_SAM.ini

**Customized ini for my setup: CRT, 60hz NTSC, S-Video adapter, only horizontal. **
  
- Excluded some Arcade games that dont look good on my setup:  
I'm using Antonio Villena's S-Video adapter and some cores don't display well on my particular setup, like Mario Bros. (shows weird colors), Asteroids (vector) and Moon Patrol (not 60hz) so I disabled them. Your list might be different from mine so I encourage you to delete the cores off the exclusion list that work for you.

- Excluded all Neo Geo Games that are not in the World Folder   
This improves the amount of games loading successfully through SAM on the Neo Geo core  

To use this ini instead of the default, rename to `MiSTer_SAM.ini`
