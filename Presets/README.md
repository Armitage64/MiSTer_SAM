# mrchrisster-MiSTer_SAM.ini

**Customized ini for my setup: CRT, 60hz NTSC, S-Video adapter, only horizontal.**
  
- Excluded some Arcade games and limited the list to only show Horizontal games.
I'm using Antonio Villena's S-Video adapter and some cores don't display well on my particular setup, like Mario Bros. (shows weird colors), Asteroids (vector) and Moon Patrol (not 60hz) so I disabled them. Your list might be different from mine so I encourage you to delete the cores off the exclusion list that work for you.

- Excluded all Neo Geo Games that are not in the World Folder   
This improves the amount of games loading successfully through SAM on the Neo Geo core  

- menuonly is set to 0. This means if I stop playing a game, SAM will load a new one, not just from the main menu.

To use this ini instead as the default, rename to `MiSTer_SAM.ini`
